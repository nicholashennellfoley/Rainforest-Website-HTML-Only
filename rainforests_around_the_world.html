        <h3>Australia - Daintree</h3>

        <P><em>The Daintree Rainforest is a region located on the north east coast of Queensland, Australia, north of Mossman and Cairns.<br>
        At around 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), the Daintree is a part of the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the Australian continent.<br>
        The Daintree Rainforest is a part of the Wet Tropics Rainforest, that spans across the Cairns Region.<br>
         The Wet Tropics Rainforest (that the Daintree is a part of) is the oldest continually surviving tropical rainforest in the world.<br>
         Along the coastline north of the Daintree River, tropical forest grows right down to the edge of the sea.</em></P>

            <p>The tropical rainforest ecosystem of the Daintree Rainforest is one of the most complex on Earth.
                <br>Its plant diversity and structural complexity is unrivaled on the Australian continent and represents the origins of other Australian flora.</p>

            <p>Millions of years ago[quantify], the Australian continent was warm and humid and rainfall was plentiful. During this time rainforest thrived in places such as the Uluru (Ayers Rock) region.
                <br> As Australia became more arid, fewer and fewer places rainforests were able to survive. In the Daintree region, however, the climate and topography were ideal, so the area became a last remaining refuge for the rainforest.
                <br> Within this refuge, many species were able to live comfortably without reason to change. Their descendants that are still living today retained many of their ancestors' primitive characteristics, some dating back 110 million years.</p>

            <p>One species in particular, Idiospermum australiense, commonly known as the idiot fruit, is one of the rarest and most primitive of the flowering plants. Its discovery in 1970 was arguably Australia’s most significant botanical find,
                <br>greatly increasing scientists awareness of just how ancient these forests really are.</p>

            <p>From a total of 19 primitive flowering plant families on Earth, 12 families are represented in the Daintree region making the highest concentration of these plants worldwide.
                <br>These ancient plant families may well hold the secret to a number of unanswered questions regarding the origins of the flowering plants – plants on which the human race depends for food and medicines.</p>

        <h3>Brazil - Amazon</h3>
        <hr>
        <!-- <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfmuyxggs/image/upload/v1546804986/Rainforest%20Website%20%28HTML%20Only%29/Images/Daintree_Rainforest.jpg" alt="Daintree Rainforest" width="700" height="30"> -->
        <P><em>The Amazon rainforest, also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America.<br>This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. <br>The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.<br> States or departments in four nations contain "Amazonas" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world,<br> with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.</em></P>

            <p>Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia.
                <br> As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity.
                <br>One in ten known species in the world lives in the Amazon rainforest. This constitutes the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world.</p>

            <p>The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species,[31] tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals.
                <br> To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region.
                <br> One in five of all bird species are found in the Amazon rainforest, and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams.
                <br>Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone.</p>

            <p>The biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer (62 acres) of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species.
                <br> A study in 1999 found one square kilometer (247 acres) of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants. The average plant biomass is estimated at 356 ± 47 tonnes per hectare.
                <br> To date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued.
                <br>The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000.</p>

            <p>The green leaf area of plants and trees in the rainforest varies by about 25% as a result of seasonal changes.
                <br> Leaves expand during the dry season when sunlight is at a maximum, then undergo abscission in the cloudy wet season. These changes provide a balance of carbon between photosynthesis and respiration.</p>

            <p>The rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard.
                <br>Among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman, jaguar, cougar, and anaconda. In the river, electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill, while piranha are known to bite and injure humans.
                <br>Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh. There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors.
                <br> Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus. Malaria, yellow fever and Dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region.</p>
